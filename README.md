# Aneek's Dotfiles 

This repo holds my dotfiles and other config files for both my primary Windows
machine and my WSL 2 setup (running Ubuntu 20.04).

Right now, this repo isn't automated at all - as of writing, I recently set up
a new machine, so these are all the settings I found myself needing to customize.
The process of setting up the new machine made me realize I needed to start 
intentionally tracking my config - both to simplify fresh setups, and to make sure
when I made config changes to the tracked repo, they were purposeful. Therefore,
this repo will remain mostly manual (copy-pasting in updates, cloning & 
re-cloning, etc) until I feel the need to write or find a scripted alternative.

## Structure

The `windows` directory contains all the files and folders for relevant Windows 10
config. This includes settings for Windows Terminal, VS Code, and Git.

The `ubuntu` directory contains the same for my WSL 2 config.
